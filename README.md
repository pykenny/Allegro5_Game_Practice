# Allegro5_Game_Practice
Practice C and how to write a simple game in C + Allegro5.

## Ideas
This project is still under early development, so please refer to this [HackMD note](https://hackmd.io/nwfPX-jZT5O-KJozp2durQ) for current thoughts and ideas. Once the draft is complete enough, I'll migrate it to this repo.

## How to run?
Check [*Allegro5*'s wiki](https://github.com/liballeg/allegro_wiki/wiki/Quickstart) for how to install *Allegro5* library on your system.

Running `make` (you'll need `MinGW` on Windows system) should compile it and generate a file named `play.exe`, then run this command to start the program:

```shell
./play.exe
```

## Control
  - Left/Right arrow key: Move the ship to left/right.
  - Space: Fire.
  - Click the exit button on screen to quit the game.
